# ðŸ’£nuk
A package manager that installs only what you need.

## Motivation
It often happens to add resources hosted on CDN to websites or web applications. CDNs, I know, are very convenient and 
quick to include a lib. But how safe is it to do it? How many times does it happen that these are unreachable 
for traffic reasons? For example, it happens to me with unkpg.com. Get the files from the node_modules folder? No! 
it is not done. Too big. So I thought of creating a simple package manager (I don't know if I can call it that) that 
simply downloads the resources you want in a folder.

***The files should be kept "local". But if you have your own CDN, even better.*** ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation
```
$ npm install -g nuk
```

## Usage

Do you need to install only the UMD version of React?
```
$ nuk install react/umd
```

After this a `vendors/react-x.x.x/` folder will be created with only the files of the React umd folder present in the package on npm.

PS: if it doesn't already exist, a configuration file called nuk.json will be automatically created. This serves as 
a configuration and for keeping track of installed packages too.

You can also install multiple packages
```
$ nuk install react/umd doz/dist
```

If you want to know quickly which files you can include in a given package then you can use "list":
```
$ nuk list react
```
You will receive an output like this

```
nuk install react/cjs
nuk install react/cjs/react.development.js
nuk install react/cjs/react.production.min.js
nuk install react/index.js
nuk install react/index.min.js
nuk install react/umd
nuk install react/umd/react.development.js
nuk install react/umd/react.production.min.js
nuk install react/umd/react.profiling.min.js
```

Do you need to uninstall?
```
$ nuk uninstall react
```

if you need to change the name of the vendors folder then add this property to the nuk.json file:
```json
{
  "folderName": "my-vendors"
}
```
